# Stars Without Numbers Local Sheets
The app can be locally hosted on a computer where users can connect to their local server and access their character sheets. This will contain all the information pertaining to the game to ease game play and make game play go smoother.

## App Sections

### Rule Book
An attempt will be made to hopefully put most of the rules in teh game. Hopefully, most of it can be copied from various sources from around the web to avoid us from having to do all the typing.

### GM Screen
There will be a screen dedicated to only the GM. Maybe allow them to password lock the session. Will allow the GM to take various notes as well as have a section where the can keep track of each encounter

### Character section
Currently the plan is to write all the character sheets to the hosts documents folder. This way there is no need to use a server to hold all the information on one computer.

## Notes
1. The first section that should be completed is the character section of the app
2. The GM screen should be completed at the same pace as the rule book. Probably a little more focus on the GM screen.
